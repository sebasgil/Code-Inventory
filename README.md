# Code-Inventory

## Purpose
This repository consists of a working portfolio of completed scripts. The scripts are partitioned into completed homework assignments and personal side-projects. All credit will be given when due.

Below you may find an index

## Completed Homeworks

* acf.m --> auto-correlation
* hw1_03_Sebastian_Gil.m --> Galactic Redenning
* hw3_04_Sebastian_Gil.m --> Chi-Squared test
* hw4_01.m --> filtering white noise (the code is horribly wrong)
* hw5.m --> fresnel coefficients (the code is terrible too)
* script1 --> Proper Motion Cleaning of NGC 6397
* hw8.py --> radiometric dating
* Climate_Design.pdf
* hw2.docx --> floor pick-up
* hw3.docx --> numerical approximations of the Poisson Distribution
* hw4.docx --> uniformly random points on the unit square
* hw5.docx --> simulate earthquake occurrences
* hw6.docx --> Monte Carlo integration
* hw7.docx --> fraud statistics
* hw8.docx --> linear regressions on random walks
* hw9.docx --> lazy Ehrenfest coin chain
